# lunamacroshotkeys
A script for lunamacros with some good hotkeys


First you need to find the ID of the Device
So with the file "besthotkeys" you will see all devices connected in you pc. To find your device, just look the console and the ID will be between two "&" just like:

"<unassigned>  :  \\?\ACPI#DLLK0782#4&**2074D6F5**&0#{884B96C3-56EF-11D1-BC8C-00A0C91405DD} [65615] :  keyboard"

You will need this: "2074D6F5"
